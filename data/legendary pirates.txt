	#1) A refitted Navy Carrier that replaces the hangars with torpedo bays
	#2) Blaster shuttle, randomly respawning every few months to track you down and get revenge. Nothing special about the ship.
	#3) Marauder+1 Behemoth, up-armored and hotrodded with extra engines.
	#4) Marauder+1 Corvette. Handles a bit worse than a corvette, but with defenses similar to a M.Falcon.
	#5) Marauder+1 Osprey. Just an all-around better Osprey.
	#6) Marauder+1 Falcon. Like a Marauder Falcon, but it has the upgrades of both variants.
	#7) Marauder+1 Leviathan. Sorta' like the +1 Falcon; it's just both upgrade paths smushed together.
	#8) Marauder Bactrian. There's already one in-game as a person ship, but this one will be capturable.
	#9) Some sort of famous smuggler. Uses merchant swizzle, hull will have built-in scan interference. Maybe a mod argosy. Basically a Millennium Falcon sort of ship.
	#10) Marauder Skein. Approaches the power level of a Carrier.

	description "The Behemoth always straddled the line between freighter and warship; the only thing preventing it from being a pirate's dream was its slow, lumbering nature. After all, you can't plunder what you can't catch. This Behemoth has been heavily modified to remove that particular weakness."
	description "	The Legendary Behemoth is a mega-battleship used for the sole purpose of plundering gigantic freighters, it's huge cargo holds and massive weaponry help it to batter down it's enemy's defenses while it's huge engines help it to outmaneuver most other ships."
