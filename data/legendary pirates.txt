	#1) A refitted Navy Carrier that replaces the hangars with torpedo bays
	#2) Blaster shuttle, randomly respawning every few months to track you down and get revenge. Nothing special about the ship.
	#3) Marauder+1 Behemoth, up-armored and hotrodded with extra engines.
	#4) Marauder+1 Corvette. Handles a bit worse than a corvette, but with defenses similar to a M.Falcon.
	#5) Marauder+1 Osprey. Just an all-around better Osprey. 
	#6) Marauder+1 Falcon. Like a Marauder Falcon, but it has the upgrades of both variants.
	#7) Marauder+1 Leviathan. Sorta' like the +1 Falcon; it's just both upgrade paths smushed together. 
	#8) Marauder Bactrian. There's already one in-game as a person ship, but this one will be capturable.
	#9) Some sort of famous smuggler. Uses merchant swizzle, hull will have built-in scan interference. Maybe a mod argosy. Basically a Millennium Falcon sort of ship.
	#10) Marauder Skein. Approaches the power level of a Carrier.

	description "The Behemoth always straddled the line between freighter and warship; the only thing preventing it from being a pirate's dream was its slow, lumbering nature. After all, you can't plunder what you can't catch. This Behemoth has been heavily modified to remove that particular weakness."
